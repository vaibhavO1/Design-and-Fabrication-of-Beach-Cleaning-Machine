# Design and Fabrication of Beach Cleaning Machine

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Beach Cleaning Machine project, a mechanical engineering initiative aimed at designing and fabricating a machine capable of efficiently cleaning beaches by removing debris and waste materials.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of a mechanized solution to enhance the cleanliness and safety of beaches, which are critical to environmental health and tourism. The Beach Cleaning Machine is designed to operate by collecting waste while sifting and returning sand back to the beach.

## Features

- **Efficient Waste Collection:** Utilizes a conveyor system to pick up waste from the sand.
- **Sand Sifting Functionality:** Sand is sifted through a mesh system, allowing it to fall back to the ground while retaining waste material.
- **Mechanized Mobility:** Powered by a combustion engine, ensuring robust performance and mobility across various beach terrains.
- **Environmental Impact:** Aims to reduce human labor, increase cleaning efficiency, and minimize the environmental footprint of beach cleaning operations.
